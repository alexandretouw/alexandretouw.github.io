  The preliminary results of the Longitudinal Evaluation of Activities related to Digital
Education ("Élaine" in French) report on the effects of allocating mobile digital
equipment (mainly tablets) on student learnings in 7th and 8th grades. These equipment
were especially distributed within the framework of the Digital Plan implemented from
2015, in the form of tablets, individually (individual mobile equipment - 1-to-1 tablets)
or collectively (mobile classrooms - MC). At the end of 7th grade, we observe a positive
effect of 1-to-1 tablets on the student results in French oral comprehension and on
their digital skills. At the end of 8th grade, the results of students receiving 1-to-1 tablets
also show a positive evolution in French reading comprehension and in mathematics
compared to non-equipped students. In general, the effects measured two years after
the distribution of 1-to-1 tablets correspond to the progression of one rank in the class
for a median student. A positive impact of MC of the same magnitude can also be
observed on mathematical and digital skills of 8th graders at the end of the school year.
The first analyses also show some differentiated effects of mobile digital equipment
according to student gender, their social background or the social composition of their
school. Data on the use of digital equipment inside and outside the classroom, as well as
the adoption of equipment by teachers allow us to explore potential mechanisms. 1-to-1
tablets availability leads teachers to include digital technologies to a greater extent into
their practices, while the availability of MC, on the other hand, has no effect.
