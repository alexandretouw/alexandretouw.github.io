#   In France, around 20% of minors and just under 10% of young adults are in the care of the Child Protection Agency, and this population tends to remain among the most vulnerable and most at risk of being subject to judicial supervision. Using administrative follow-up data from child welfare services matched with judicial data, I study the long-term trajectories of beneficiaries of child protection measures and the main determinants of their judicial outcomes. In a second phase, I plan to build a matched database to study their education, labour market and health outcomes. In a final step, this database will allow me to study the impact of specific child protection measures on long-term life outcomes.
