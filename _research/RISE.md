  Refugees face significant mental health challenges, with high prevalence of psychological distress stemming from traumatic experiences and migration-related stressors. These symptoms tend to greatly reduce their ability to find stable accommodation and employment. Despite critical needs, refugees consistently underutilise mental health services due to structural and sociocultural barriers such as stigma, linguistic challenges, and limited system comprehension. This randomised controlled trial investigates the effectiveness of two interventions among 2,500 recently recognised refugees in Paris : discussions with peer-helpers to break down the stigma surrounding mental health and a dedicated mental health helpline allowing them to delegate the process of booking appointments at healthcare facilities. Randomly assigned to four groups, participants will be tracked on key outcomes including mental health service utilisation, PTSD and depression symptom severity, employment status, and social integration. By testing targeted support mechanisms, the study aims to identify low-cost, scalable approaches to improving refugees’ mental health access and overall socioeconomic integration.
