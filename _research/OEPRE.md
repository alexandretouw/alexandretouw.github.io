  This paper studies the effect of a large French national programme implemented by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of the Interior which targets allophone immigrant parents with children in the French school system. It offers free in-school training, including French language courses, sessions on the functioning and expectations of the school system, and sessions on the principles and values of the French Republic. We build on a survey of 800 allophone parents in 150 different primary schools and administrative data to study the effects of this programme on (i) parental involvement in their children’s education, (ii) the development and learning of children, and (iii) the socio-economic inclusion of parents.
