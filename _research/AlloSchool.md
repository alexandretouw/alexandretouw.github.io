  Developed by a French startup specialising in digital educational applications for children with specific needs, the *AlloSchool* app aims to facilitate the integration of newly arrived allophone students by providing personalised educational content, allowing them to progress at their own pace, while taking their mother tongue into account. The experiment planned to randomly allocate access to the application as well as training sessions on the application to 200 specialist teachers of French as a second language, representing around 2,000 pupils. By matching results from surveys conducted among immigrant parents and teachers with children's cognitive test results and administrative data, we aim to assess the impact of this intervention on (i) the development, learning, and social integration of children, (ii) parental involvement in education, as well as (iii) teaching practices in a multicultural context.
