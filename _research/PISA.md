  This paper examines whether academic self-beliefs help explain social gaps in educational and career expectations among 15-year-olds across OECD countries. We document large SES-based gaps in expectations in almost all countries, even among equally performing students in the same schools and tracks. Lower-SES students also report systematically lower academic self-beliefs than their high-SES counterparts, reflecting lower perceived chances of success. While these beliefs are associated with expectations, they account for only a small part of the SES gap in expectations. Our findings suggest that equalising academic self-beliefs is unlikely to eliminate disparities in expectations, pointing instead to deeper structural or cultural drivers of educational inequality.
