#   Lower educational expectations and socio-emotional skills are associated with poorer school and life outcomes, even after controlling for a large set of factors. This research paper investigates socioeconomic disparities in students’ self-confidence, hope and educational and career expectations. Using PISA 2018 data, we document large social gaps in socio-emotional skills as well as in both academic and professional expectations in every OECD countries. We find suggestive evidence that self-confidence and perceived return to education have a clear association with expectations. This association holds even among equally-performing students in almost every country.
